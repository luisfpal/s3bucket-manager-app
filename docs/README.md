# Bucket Explorer Documentation

Reading order for maintainers and operators.

## Public documentation policy

Files in `docs/` are **public**: they must be self-contained so another operator or maintainer can deploy, test, and understand the system without private notes.

- Keep how-to guides, architecture, API contracts, and placeholder templates here.
- Do not add release checklists, session todos, or links to local-only paths (`internal_docs/`, `PLAN.md`, agent instruction files).
- Maintainer-specific registry or CI accounts may be documented when they reflect the current deployment, with a note that future teams must substitute their own.
